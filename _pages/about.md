<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a fourth-year doctoral student in the Department of Business Analytics and Information Systems at Auburn University. My research centers on Business Analytics, Artificial Intelligence, and Information Systems, with a focus on understanding how digital innovations and social dynamics shape firm strategies and performance. My research bridges the gap between technology and business, offering insights into strategic management in the era of digital transformation.

My research interests include
- Stream 1: Digital Innovation Strategies and Economic Impacts

Exploring how emerging technologies like AI and blockchain influence organizational strategies, employee dynamics, and customer experiences, with a particular focus on fostering sustainability and social equity.

- Stream 2: Social Media, Platform Engagement, and Firm Performance

Investigating how organizations leverage social networks and platform data to optimize branding, manage crises, and enhance customer relationships, while driving competitive advantage.

My research has received multiple recognitions. For instance, my AMCIS2024 proceeding and PACIS 2023 proceeding papers were nominated for the conferences‚Äô best paper, and my paper in the AMCIS 2022 proceeding was ranked in the top 25%. My work has been published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research and the International Journal of Hospitality Management.
